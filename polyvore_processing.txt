Place the contents of polyvore.tar.gz and polyvore-images.tar.gz in a folder called 'polyvore', such that the file structure is like:

polyvore
|- fill_in_blank_test.json
|- test_no_dup.json
|- train_no_dup.json
|- valid_no_dup.json
|- fashion_compatibility_prediction.txt
|- images/

Then, run the following commands in the images folder:
find . -mindepth 2 -type f -print -exec mv --backup=numbered {} . \;
rm -R -- */

(Note: the find command can take a while to run, it has to go through thousands of folders)
